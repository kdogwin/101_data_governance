## 1. Data Governance <a name="dg"></a>
DG is a practice that connects different components together such as roles, processes, communincations, metrics and tools to increase datas value. <br>
By harmonising these fundementals, governance ensures that the right data flows effeciently to the right resources at the right time. <br>
While DG forms an essential part of Data Management, it does not encompass all aspects of data management. Instead, governance focuses specifically on structuring ploicies and procedures around the data.<br>
Organisations prioritise DG to get better data quality and BI as well as to protect their information and comply with international regulatory bodies GDPR.
